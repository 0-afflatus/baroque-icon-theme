Baroque is a dark GTK3/2 theme. It's a rather steampunk affair, featuring mahogany dashboards with brass fittings tastefully set with rubies and amethysts.

There is room for improvement in many of the icons; contributions welcome. The aim is to maintain compatibility with GPL and Free Desktop standards. Also to create a look that is as unlike Windows, OSX or indeed any other proprietary operating system, whilst maintaining efficiency and beauty.
